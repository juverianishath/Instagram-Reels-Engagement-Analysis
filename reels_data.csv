I did not come from generational wealth, I didn't have any resources, contacts, investment money or someone to look up to who looked like me, talked like me, had a financial background like me. 
I will always remember this one time where i tried giving my room a 'pinteresty' look for a video & and was met by so much trolling for it being ""low standard, cluttered or not cool enough"" made me feel so small & helpless in a million ways. I still remember saving around ₹1500 and ordering 4 sheets of white brick wall stickers from amazon. It was the best 1.5k i had ever spent. 
Last year I won an award, hit 1 million subscribers, bought my dream house, built a safe space and yet i felt unworthy. Did i work for it or did i just get lucky? aah the self doubt rabbit hole.

So last night I tried talking to my younger self, the 2016 Aditi who made the most of every cloth fabric as her BG, who used a single eyeshadow palette to do her blush, contour, highlight & brows, who made shopping at sarojini nagar her whole identity because that is all she could afford, who somehow in her twisted brain thought that making videos will change her life. So I thanked her for doing exactly that- changing my life. Aditi, they were wrong, we made it, we have a roof over our heads now and mummy papa are proud, ravi is enjoying, everyone knows you, people respect your journey. You're surely going to go through a hell lot of things to get here that no one will ever know about. But i need you to let go of all the ghosts that haunt you or they will haunt you forever. Please set yourself free. 

So here's me letting go of the self doubt, cherishing my life, celebrating myself, taking my power back, doing what i do best- creating content, a reel that captures the essence of my side of the story 💕 because 2016 Aditi is proud of 2023 Quirky 🥹",,2196,5

Watch my previous reels to see what went down into finding the perfect outfit🙈

Fun fact: I saw this in the Hyderabad TT store itself. It was actually not on my radar at all, my Dad spotted it on the mannequin and asked me to try. However, I was hesitant as it felt too contemporary. I wanted something with a slightly traditional touch (such as the TT outfit I showcased in #AnnayasPelliE2). But the more I saw it, the more costume-ish it looked🫠 

If there was one outfit I couldn’t stop thinking about, it was this one! So all props to my Dad for this, truly he has amazing taste 😂🙌🏼🧿

Step 1: Open the document shared in our broadcast channel.

Step 2: Upload a clear selfie with no messy background.

Step 3: Upload the selfie in Gemini, select Nano Banana, and simply copy-paste the desired prompt.
You can edit the names, date, and venue directly in the prompt before generating.

Step 4: After creating all the images, you can animate or add motion to turn them into a video.
For this, go to https://grok.com/imagine, upload your photo, and you’re done.
You can also adjust animation style, background music, and text overlays to match your wedding theme.

Final Step: Once all your images are converted into videos, open any video editing app, merge all the clips, and your AI wedding invitation video will be ready.
You can use editors like CapCut, VN, or InShot to easily arrange clips, add transitions, and export in HD quality.

Most people don’t know this, but the Government actually launched a Senior Citizen Card that costs only Rs.10 and gives huge benefits to elders across India.

From free hearing aids in Punjab, free doctor visits for bedridden seniors in Kerala, to free spectacles and walking sticks in Tamil Nadu, and flight (upto 25%) and train ( upto50%) ticket discounts — every state offers something valuable for our elders.

To apply, visit the official portal:
[https://services.india.gov.in/service/listing?ln=en&cat_id=44&sort=hit_count@desc]

Choose your state, then click on the Senior Citizen ID Card service link.
Fill the form, upload your age proof and address proof, pay just Rs.10, and submit.
Once verified, you’ll get your card digitally or by post, depending on your state’s process.

So if your grandparents or parents are above 60, help them apply today. It’s a small step that ensures they get the respect and facilities they truly deserve.

India just launched its own cab service called Bharat Taxi.

It’s set to take on OLA and Uber with cheaper rides for customers and zero commission for drivers. Instead, drivers will pay a small weekly or monthly fee.

Launching this December across metro cities, but the big question is—how will they maintain safety, driver behaviour, and car quality?

Would you switch from OLA and Uber to Bharat Taxi?

Now you can pay without entering your PIN.
Just use your fingerprint or face ID and it’s done.

And this is just the beginning.
Soon, ChatGPT will order groceries for you and make payments automatically.
NPCI, Razorpay, and OpenAI have introduced agentic payments using UPI Reserve Pay.
Money gets blocked first and is only deducted once your order is confirmed.
If the order is cancelled, the amount comes back instantly.

Right now, it’s being tested with BigBasket.
But in the future, it might come to Blinkit, Flipkart, and Amazon too.

And the craziest part, you’ll soon make payments through your smart glasses.
Meta Ray-Ban has already tested this.
Just say “Hey Meta, scan and pay 90 rupees” and the payment is done.

If you’re tired of writing vanilla apps and want to build ML systems instead, this one’s for you.

Step 1 – Learn Python and SQL (not Java, C++, or JavaScript).
→ Focus on pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib
→ For SQL: use LeetCode or StrataScratch to practice real-world queries
→ Don’t just write code—learn to think in data

Step 2 – Build your foundation in statistics + math.
→ Start with Practical Statistics for Data Scientists
→ Learn: probability, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, distributions
→ Brush up on linear algebra (vectors, dot products) and calculus (gradients, chain rule)

Step 3 – Learn ML the right way.
→ Do Andrew Ng’s ML course (Deeplearning.ai)
→ Master the full pipeline: cleaning → feature engineering → modeling → evaluation
→ Read Elements of Statistical Learning or Sutton & Barto if you want to go deeper

Step 4 – Build 2–3 real, messy projects.
→ Don’t follow toy tutorials
→ Use APIs or scrape data, build full pipelines, and deploy using Streamlit or Gradio
→ Upload everything to GitHub with a clear README

Step 5 – Become a storyteller with data.
→ Read Storytelling with Data by Cole Knaflic
→ Learn to explain your findings to non-technical teams
→ Practice communicating precision/recall/F1 in simple language

Step 6 – Stay current. Never stop learning.
→ Follow PapersWithCode (it's now sun-setted, use huggingface.co/papers/trending, ArXiv Sanity, and follow ML practitioners on LinkedIn

→ Join communities, follow researchers, and keep shipping new experiments

-------
Save this for later.
Tag a friend who’s trying to make the switch.

(No degree, no prior experience needed. Just consistency and curiosity.)

Step 1: Learn Python (Weeks 1–4)
→ Do “Python for Everybody” or freeCodeCamp
→ Practice daily for 30 minutes
→ Push everything to GitHub — even your messy code
→ Start building your proof of work from Day 1

Step 2: Get ML Foundations (Weeks 5–8)
→ Take Andrew Ng’s ML course (still gold)
→ Pick 1 project on Kaggle (Titanic is great for starters)
→ Train a basic model → deploy it with Streamlit
→ Now you’ve built your first ML app 👏

Step 3: Deep Learning Phase (Months 3–4)
→ Learn through fast.ai — super hands-on
→ Fine-tune a small transformer (like BERT) on Hugging Face
→ Don’t aim for perfection, aim to finish one project well

Step 4: Understand Transformers & LLMs (Months 5–6)
→ Rebuild a mini GPT using Karpathy’s nanoGPT
→ This will help you actually understand self-attention, tokens, and training loops
→ Watch explainer videos + read blog posts to reinforce the concepts

Step 5: Learn the Real LLM Stack (Months 7–9)
→ LangChain for chaining prompts & calling tools
→ LangGraph for multi-agent workflows and memory
→ Weaviate or LanceDB for retrieval (RAG setups)
→ QLoRA for fine-tuning open models
→ vLLM for efficient inference

Step 6: Build and Publish (Months 10–12)
→ Choose one simple use case (like a research assistant or AI chatbot)
→ Build it end-to-end using the stack you’ve learned
→ Make a demo video, write a short architecture breakdown
→ Share on GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter — this is your new resume

If you’ve ever stared at that “Start a post” box and thought, what do I even say? — you’re not alone.
Your first few posts don’t need to be perfect. They just need to be real. 

Talk about what you’re learning, what you’re building, or who inspired you this week.

here are 5 projects you can build right now to get your hands dirty with the latest tools, and actually understand how things work end-to-end 👇🏽

🛠️ 1. Build an ML Pipeline from Scratch
Project: Predict which students are at risk of dropping out
→ Pull attendance + grades → clean in Pandas/Polars
→ Train with LightGBM → track with MLflow
→ Deploy via FastAPI + Docker → push to AWS Lambda
→ Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions
💡 This is a full ML lifecycle in one project.

💬 2. Build a RAG Chatbot
Project: A chatbot that answers questions from course notes
→ Chunk + embed using LlamaIndex / Cohere / VoyageAI
→ Store in Weaviate or FAISS
→ Use an open-source LLM like Mistral or Qwen
→ UI in Gradio or Streamlit
💡 Great hands-on intro to how GenAI apps actually work.

🧠 3. Fine-Tune an LLM for a Domain
Project: A medical or finance assistant
→ Collect PubMed papers or SEC filings
→ Fine-tune with QLoRA/DPO
→ Start with Mistral or DeepSeek Coder
→ Evaluate on factuality + accuracy
→ Deploy with Modal or Fireworks AI
💡 Helps you go deeper into foundation model adaptation.

🚨 4. Monitor for Model Drift
Project: A fraud detection system that stays effective post-launch
→ Serve with BentoML
→ Track drift using Evidently AI or WhyLabs
→ Use Airflow/Prefect for retraining
→ Visualize everything in Grafana
💡 Most ML projects die post-deployment, this one shows you can maintain.

🍽️ 5. Build a Multimodal AI App
Project: Snap a photo of food → get nutrition + recipes
→ Use Florence-2 or CLIP for vision embeddings
→ Add Qwen-VL or LLaVA for reasoning
→ Build the UI with Streamlit
💡 You’ll learn how to mix modalities and push boundaries.

None of these are “easy,” but that’s the point.
They’ll teach you the actual workflow, data prep → modeling → deployment → monitoring.
And they’ll stand out when someone looks at your GitHub or portfolio.

If you’re preparing for your next AI engineering interview,

Networking starts when you start showing up — by connecting with intention, engaging with people’s content, and reaching out when it actually makes sense.

If you’re serious about landing your next role, start by building visibility. Because recruiters don’t just post jobs anymore — they search for talent.
And visibility comes from connection.

Switching from pads & tampons to period panties changed everything about how I bleed & I wish that for every menstruator- the comfort, awareness, even how I feel about my cycle -it’s so different than it was with tampons/pads. 

No stickiness, no dryness, no constant checking. Just soft, breathable fabric that I live in. I honestly forget I’m even bleeding. I prefer the modal ones over the cotton. They feel softer but cotton is more economical if you’re on a budget. Use my code for a 15% off ok- applicable only on panties and not packs 🫶🏻

Most disposable pads & tampons contain bleach, dioxins, & fragrance chemicals that are known to interfere with women’s hormones & contribute to disorders like PCOS, endometriosis, & fertility issues. It’s really sad but it’s true. I gave up on pads in 2016 & used tampons till 2023 - uff, the harm I’ve caused my body unknowingly, wish there was more awareness around the same as there is now. All those medicines, ultrasounds, pain, panic & irregular periods I went through because of my PCOS - I wish that upon no one. 

Rinse → machine wash → sun dry. That’s it. They last for years, so I haven’t bought pads or tampons in 2 whole years. I did experiment with a menstrual cup but I think it’s not particularly inclusive especially for women with vaginismus. It does the job but sometimes I do panic when I’m unable to get it out or put it back inside.. 😥Period panties that way, are every uterus friendly & stress free. 😅

I now bleed guilt free. No tampons and pads have gone to the landfill because of me in the last 24 months. 🎉🎉 Feels like an achievement to be honest!

Also, my flow feels more natural & I feel more in sync with my body - hard to explain but it just happens.
And well, about Mahina - there’s something safe about knowing you don’t need a product designed for convenience, you just need something designed with care & with an all women’s team, you don’t expect anything less! I love what they’ve done & i’m very grateful they exist.

I promise you will feel the same way. 🫶🏻

Lala Munshi Ram’s (my Daadu’s name was also Munshi Ram!!) journey began in Pakpattan, Pakistan, where their renowned confectionery shop, ‘Toshe,’ flourished. 

After the partition in 1947, they relocated to Fazilka, India, with their five sons, establishing ‘Tosha,’ in 1949, a new confectionery shop. Over the years, their dedication led to the shop’s success, earning it the moniker ‘Fazilka ka Tosha.’ 

Today, the third generation has rebranded it as “Pakpattaniyan di Hatti,” breathing new life into the legacy. Collaborating with Mandeep from United Foods, the fourth generation introduced enticing flavors and improved packaging, extending the shelf life to two months.

‘Tosha’ symbolizes love and unity, captivating customers with its exceptional taste and leaving them longing for more. 

the website is www.toshewala.in :)

For me, Tosha reminds me of my grandparents (all four) and all that they had to leave behind during the partition..homes, cattle, land, families…it’s utterly nostalgic, bittersweet, and satisfies in me the longing to get to know life on the other side. May never happen in this lifetime but this is the closest I’ll get :)

I’m sure most North Indians whose ancestors come from the other side of the border, feel that longing often too. 🌸 Let me know if you resonate :) Does your family also come from the other side of the border? 💕

I saw Raan on Google Maps in a village called Are & looked at how far it was from Dapoli, where I was at the time. Only an hour-ish by road - so I immediately booked 6 nights & left for Guhagar :)

🌸 The place is the brainchild of a very cool 33 year old called Mohit who is an absolute nerd & will excitedly tell you more than you need to know about Guhagar, Maharashtra, the tribal culture, the food, the caste system, the women who work at the property, will also casually spot species of birds and butterflies in hopes you will remember.

🌸 An engineer by “profession”, he is someone who has worked & lived in France & Chile, & very naturally picked up Spanish & French as languages he still talks in. He also backpacked through South America in 2017 & learnt about sustainable living from the tribes & locals he met, which ended up changing the course of his life in incredibly profound ways. He came back to India knowing he certainly wants to do something in sustainable travel..what, he wasn’t sure of, but he knew he wanted to do his best in preserving the many cultures & traditions of Maharashtra, one tribal village at a time. Thus, began his little venture called Swadesee, a platform that connected urban people to rural Maharashtra. Unfortunately, it took a hit during the pandemic & hasn’t been operational since. However, the soul & intention of Swadesee was carefully transferred into Raan (which means wild in Marathi) & continues to linger in every decision he takes for the place. 

🌸 There are around 11 local women who run the entire place- from the reception, to housekeeping, to cooking in the kitchen. They’re well respected, well paid & love meeting new people from all over. 

🌸 Pets are not allowed because there’s so much wildlife around Raan that needs to be protected in the smallest ways possible.

🌸 Pre booking on their website is a must- no walk ins

🌸 Direct buses exist from Mumbai to Guhagar & the closest train station to Raan is Chiplun. 

🌸 their website has all info you’ll need before coming

🌸 NO ACs here!

✨ Why every woman should take Magnesium + Omega-3 daily✨

🌸Magnesium = calm in a capsule
 
- Relaxes muscles (including the uterus) and reduces cramps.
 - Calms the nervous system, eases anxiety, and supports deep sleep.
 - Helps with bloating, mood swings, and PMS irritability.

🌸 Omega-3 = anti-inflammatory magic
 - Reduces prostaglandins — the compounds behind painful period cramps.
 - Balances hormones, lifts mood, and nourishes your skin and brain.
 - Supports long-term heart and joint health too.

🌸 Together = 🥹🥹🥹
 - When taken daily, they help regulate inflammation, stabilise energy, and make your cycle gentler.
 - You start feeling more in tune with your body — lighter, calmer, and clearer through every phase.

🌿 What I personally take:

I’ve been using Aceblend’s Magnesium and Omega-3 for months now & it’s made a noticeable difference in my PMS and energy levels.

- Their high absorption Magnesium Glycinate is gentle on the stomach and genuinely helps me sleep better. It’s a kind of liposomal magnesium!

-Their Omega-3 (1650 mg Fish oil) is made of deep sea Peruvian anchovies and doesn’t have that odd aftertaste most fish oils do.

If you’re in a city, you might find them on Blinkit or Swiggy Instamart but in case you want to save some 💰💰you can order from their website and use my code SRISHTI for a 15% off - the combo price will come down to ₹1500ish which is so so reasonable for the quality Ace Blend has! 

⚡️ How I take them:

Magnesium → at night before bed
Omega-3 → in the morning with breakfast

or sometimes, when I can’t care too much, I eat both together in the morning with my coffee! I take 1 pill of each, everyday 

This combo is honestly one of the simplest, most effective ways to support your hormones naturally. A tiny daily ritual that changes everything. 💛

Quitting smoking + starting with these supplements around the same time in June really really helped. I’m glad it’s now a part of my daily routine. ✌🏼

Hope this helps. Love x

There was a time when travelling across India felt like falling in love again and again. Every journey had a heartbeat of its own, dhabba stops on mountain roads, laughter with strangers who became family, the chaos, the dust, the sunsets that made everything worth it. 
 But somewhere along the way, something changed. The way the government was functioning, the growing divide, the exhaustion - it all began to weigh on me. The very fabric of this country that once felt colourful and alive started to feel worn out. I think I slowly fell out of love with India, not because I stopped caring, but because watching her crumble in parts broke my heart.

So I began to look outward.
 Over the last few years, I’ve travelled to Bangladesh, Borneo, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Thailand, Vietnam, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Germany etc. Each country taught me something about culture, about humanity, about myself. Some were chaotic and soulful, some calm and pristine. Yet, even in all that movement, something inside me always felt slightly untethered.

And then I went to Hampi.
 A single week there changed everything. The wild landscapes, the sunsets, the warmth of strangers, the quiet honesty of it all - it reminded me of the India I once knew. The one that makes you feel alive even when everything around you feels uncertain.

It’s strange.. I’ve seen so much of the world this year, yet it was one small corner of my own country that reminded me why I fell in love with travel in the first place.

I’m not abandoning the world - there’s still so much I want to explore.. but I’m coming home differently now. Not rerouting, just reconnecting.
Because for all her flaws and contradictions, India still holds everything I’ve ever been searching for - rawness, depth, humanity, truth. And maybe, in finding my way back to her, I’ll find my way back to myself too.

🇲🇳 In Mongolia, horses are everything. They’re family, transport, strength, pride and sometimes, food.
It’s hard to understand that at first. Especially when you grow up seeing horses as sacred, wild, untouchable beings. But here, they’re not just symbols of beauty; they’re a way of life.

The Mongolian way of living is deeply intertwined with nature - not in a poetic, Instagram kind of way, but in a raw, matter-of-fact way. When winter lasts eight months and temperatures drop below -40°C, survival isn’t about choice, it’s about coexistence.

Everything in nature gives, and sometimes, everything is taken back.

You start to see that morality looks different when life depends on balance. That what feels right or wrong isn’t universal, it’s shaped by where you live, what the land gives, and what it demands in return.

Here, you don’t get to control nature; you adapt to it. You respect it. You thank it. And sometimes, that means accepting realities that make you uncomfortable.

In the end, you realise this truth that Mongolia teaches so quietly - life doesn’t always fit into right and wrong. Sometimes it just is what it is.

A quiet reminder that coexistence isn’t about comfort…it’s about understanding.

If you were here, would you eat horse me@t - or would you pass? Be honest. 🐎 

I personally didn’t and won’t try but I am taking the tooth as a souvenir of the Mongol spirit. 🌸

📍 The Blue Wagon Cafe, Siolim, North Goa

We hardly ever get to know the faces behind a cafe, where they come from, who they are, was it a dream or simply something they got into, the risks they took, the money they lost, the resilience they showed in a new industry. Running a hospitality business especially when you have no experience is nothing less than entrepreneurial. 🩵

I’m glad Ipsa and Hitesh are only 5 minutes away from me, i’m so glad I got to document their story, understand where they come from and know their journey deeper. And all of this, because one random afternoon, I found myself at The Blue Wagon, enjoying jis Habanero and Lemon Aglio Olio..we simply got talking and the rest is history 🧿 Ipsa is the sweetest, most affection person and Hitesh has a big beautiful talkative heart. Haha, together they have created something so precious - it’s worth all the love. 

Today, 26th September- marks 10 years since they started dating! Crazy what a decade together looks like. 

Thanks Hitesh for going through your old drive folders and facebook photos to retrieve these old images- i’m so glad we get to see this journey 💙

Hope you guys try this place out and 100% DO NOT FORGET about the Iced Coconut Cappuccino- it’s yummm! ☕️

I first booked a very random place in Hampi for the night and was left so disappointed. ☹️ Then, I remembered there is a Zostel somewhere around and immediately knew what to do- I put it on google maps, it was some 20 kms away! So I rented a scooty the next day, loaded my bag and left! Uff- BEST DECISION!🌸

✨The property has its own story - everyone in the climbing (boulders) community knows of Sharmila aunty and her three sons, from the Goan Corner, an old establishment in the Hampi Island that was demolished alongside 18 others in March 2020. While they were left homeless for 3 months, they knew they have to start again…bigger, better…which made them purchase this land, away from everything, and start afresh. What you see here is years of hard work, resilience and a zeal that brought the Goan Corner back to life and they continue to host thousands of people every year and keep them happy.

They also have a deep love for animals, gardening, sustainable architecture and it shows! There’s also bunnies, turtles, fish and monitor lizards!!🦎 

And yes they’re under the Zostel umbrella but the place is FULLY family run. It’s amazing to be around them, the way they treat their guests and help them, the way the staff takes care of you and the way the ANIMALSSSSS, alll of them, make sure to let you not be sad even for a second!! it’s amazing 🥰🥰🥰

If you ever find yourself planning a trip to Hampi, book Zostel Hampi to have the best time! 

🪐 I met such lovely souls from all over, spent time with them, swam in the pond, doodled, went on scooty rides, watched movies in the dining hall and spent SO MUCH TIME IN THE LAP OF NATURE 🍃🌱

📅 Hampi’s season time is September to February and post that; it’s toooo hot to do anything! So plan a trip soon 🫶🏻 

Have a beautiful trip- don’t be obsessed with sightseeing. Take everyday as it comes, in Hampi🧡

PS. If you don’t like animals, then don’t go here. Don’t expect them to accommodate their pets as per your liking.

warning ⚠️ please look out for snakes, leeches and cops if you go & do not jump into quarries if you don’t see anyone around. many a people have lost their lives over the last few years & that’s why there’s usually restrictions at their entryways. please stay safe. 

what you see here is called a quarry, which is essentially a scar left behind by the mining industry in goa. back in the day when Goa was ruled by the Portuguese, some 800 mines were set up all over the state for manganese, iron, laterite and red soil. along the way, traditional societies collapsed. Migration into Goa was heavy. handling of machinery- trucks, barges was the domain of men. Women lost status, from being equals in the fields, they were progressively non-earning. as scale increased, the damage multiplied. fields became less and less productive. smoke was spewed by trucks while iron ore dust blew off trucks and barges. khazan bunds were damaged in the process and so much more…leading to a collapse of another long lived society.

things finally changed once Goa became liberated from the Portuguese in 1961 and in 1987, after a number of previous efforts, the Indian government abolished mining altogether. it wasn’t a profitable industry, was the cause of mass ecological destruction and its impact on the Goan society was deeply problematic. by 2007, after a lot of malpractices, PILs, Supreme Court hearings, mining in goa eventually became illegal. 

these abandoned quarries that become natural pools/reservoirs of rainwater are a symbol of all that was lost and all that was saved. every monsoon, locals and migrants alike, spend time at these quarries, away from the quiet to enjoy the rare sunny days in the four month long monsoon that heralds goa every year. ✨

the current government has thrown all the efforts away, of people who finally made it possible for goa to be mining free, and restarted mining in a very hushed manner, by renewing leases to the same miners.

things are changing rapidly, & its very unsettling to be in the midst of it, knowing very well the damage today’s decisions will cause.

as for today & this day, all i am and can be, is grateful. 🌸

✨ I used to believe studying abroad is expensive but my recent trip to Bamberg changed everything. It is actually affordable- I I was just looking at the wrong options!🙈 Public universities in Germany are utterly economical & have an impeccable standard of education. Most charge no tuition fees at all, just a small semester fee while private universities can burn a hole of €10,000–€20,000 a year in your pocket! That’s money you could spend on travel, a good rental accommodation, experiences, food, and actually living your life.

✨Take the University of Bamberg. The fee for most courses even for international students is around 120€ per semester!! 😳 I was so shocked when I heard about it for the first time- like seriously? That’s it? It’s a cosy, student-friendly public uni with 5 campuses spread across Bamberg and you can choose from programmes like International Software Systems Science, Strategy & Sustainability, English and American Studies, and even dual degrees in Political Science and Sociology. Most Indians here are seen taking up Computer Sciences 😝 

✨There are courses in English, but if you know German, your options (& your everyday life) open up massively.

✨Ohhh also, learning German before you arrive is the smartest investment you’ll make. It means house-hunting without stress, breezing through bureaucratic paperwork, ordering your coffee without pointing at the menu, and finding part-time work more easily. A few months of language classes cost way less than a single semester at a private university and the payoff is priceless. Check out @german_with_amit 📖📚

✨Also you won’t be alone - the Indian community in Germany is thriving, now over 300,000 strong. You’ll find friendly faces, cultural events, and a network that makes this new chapter feel a little like home.

What I’ve learnt? Pick a public university like Bamberg, learn some German, save for a year, arrive not just debt-free, but ready to live a good life in Germany. 🤓

I’m SERIOUSLY considering!! It would be a really cool thing to do for my own self. 🌿

We loved Georgia so much we are going to go here again ❤️🇬🇪

🚙 We rented a Toyota Rav4 from this website called localrent.com after checking quite a few pricy websites and completely giving up on our road trip plan. The car cost us 400$/ 34,000₹ for 9 days with full insurance, no deposit. Divided between two, it was only 200$/ 17,155₹ each. 

🪪 An IDP (International Driving Permit) was required so I suggest logging on to www.internationaldriversassociation.com and getting one for yourself (get the 3 year one- higher value). That costs around ₹8000 with hard copy + courier. 

🤑 Our car rental gave us a code to use at the Wissol Petrol pumps which gave us a 15% off on Premium petrol and the mileage of the car was superb. Overall, we spent around ₹12,000 on fuel. 

✈️ Our flights from Delhi to Tbilisi cost approx ₹18,000 each. And, our outbound flight from Kutaisi to Frankfurt cost approx ₹17,000 each. 

🏨 Accomodation mostly always cost us anywhere between ₹900-₹1800 each. Hostels, guest houses, home stays and hotels included. 

🍛 The food always cost us anywhere between ₹250-1500 per person depending on the place. 

🇺🇸 We didn’t need to apply for a visa separately as we each have a US visa. 

💰 According to our Splitwise, we ended up spending around ₹1,80,000 for 13 days including stay, food, flights, car rental, miscellaneous purchases, fuel, entry fees to places, wine etc! 

🥹 1000% returning for a second road trip. Autumn, it’ll loooook unimaginably beautiful!!🍁🍂

Places we recommend: 

✨ 3-4 days in Tbilisi Old Town
✨ 3-4 days in and around Kazbegi (Dariali, Sno, Juta)
✨ 3-4 days in Racha (or Svaneti) 
✨2 days in the Martvili region (can totally avoid the Martvili Canyon and opt for local waterfalls instead) 
✨ 3 days in Batumi + Kutaisi 

⏱️Best time to visit Georgia: CAN I HIGHLY SUGGEST AUTUMN?? 🍂 Omg, if you’re planning your Georgia trip, let it be in October. Everything will be orange, red, auburn!

The kind that wasn’t just outside- traffic, horns, generators during power cuts.
It was inside too.
Tuition at 5. Homework by 7. Eat fast. Sleep early.
Be better. Be quiet. Be grateful.
Become an engineer, a doctor. Or don’t come home with dreams. 

Our cities were in-between.
Saharanpur and Jabalpur.
Not quite big enough to offer options.
Not small enough to offer silence.
So we lived in cement houses with tiled floors and repressed feelings,
where “what will people say” echoed louder than our own voices.

We didn’t have forests.
We didn’t talk about therapy.
We talked about marks, medals, and that neighbour’s kid who cracked IIT.
Home wasn’t always safe.
Sometimes, it was a battleground of unhealed adults and scared children playing the role of a happy family.

And yet,
somewhere in that mess, we held onto wonder.
I came to Goa two years ago, thinking I was just moving.
I didn’t know I was going to unlearn how to rush through life.
I didn’t know silence would feel like a balm.
I didn’t know mornings could begin with birdsong and not dread.
That there was something sacred in soft rains, in sitting on the floor to eat,
in conversations that didn’t need fixing…just presence.
The slowness rewired our nervous systems. 
The coconut trees and the sea listened better than people ever did.

Now, the silence feels addictive.
The calm isn’t a luxury, it’s medicine.
And for the first time in a long time,
We are not surviving.
We are simply…here. Alive. Healing. Becoming.

Big thanks to the mountains of Georgia for letting us be, to allowing us to dwell in the silence, to feel, to smile and simply exist. This will not be our last visit. ❤️✨

If you only visit one market in Tbilisi, let it be this one. Not for the souvenirs, but for the stories.
A market of memories - yes, that’s what it is. Laid out under the Georgian sun, come summer, spring, autumn or even sometimes in winter, the Dry Bridge Flea Market has been around since before I was born! 

From Soviet medals to hand-painted ceramics, this Market in Tbilisi is a living archive of stories. I had randomly marked it on my Maps and wasn’t sure if I’ll end up visiting. However, the weather was beautiful and it was day 3 in Tbilisi when I decided to walk 27 minutes from Old Town to the bridge and see what the market looks like. I had zero expectations but I left feeling pleased with myself for coming here. 

✨ This place may not be everyone’s cup of tea. It’s not posh, not touristy. Not everyone likes to or has the patience to sort through each and every stall to look for a piece they’ll end up picking up. Hence, I’ve mentioned, it’s specifically for collectors. Collectors of weird items and old, of cutlery and home decor pieces, old cameras (working and non working), silver and brass antiques- you’re essentially invited to have a peek into someone’s personal collection and pay for a piece if you like.

✨ Please don’t bargain like your life depends on it. Not here. Eventually, they’ll simply start getting angrier with tourists if you behave improperly so just don’t be irritating. People price things very decently, at least presently. Maximum you can try and bargain by a few Laris if you’re picking up more than a piece but please don’t insist too hard. You’ll understand better once you visit why I’m saying so. 🫶🏻

✨ You’ll definitely end up spending a few hours here so come prepared. 

📍 Dry Bridge Flea Market, Tbilisi
🕰 Open daily, 11 am (or 12 pm, Georgia wakes up slowly) to 5 pm (weather dependent)
💸 Bring cash 

Hope you end up visiting- tell me if you do!❤️❤️

I thought I was just cleaning my cupboard.
But halfway through, sitting with a mountain of old clothes and memories, I realised I was actually sitting with myself.

Each piece had a story. A phase. A version of me I had not met in a while. Some still felt like home. Others felt like someone I used to know.

It made me pause. I have been holding on. To things I no longer wear, habits I no longer need, and identities I have quietly outgrown.

I used to think I needed more. More space, more options, more stuff, just in case.
But maybe what I have been craving is not more. Maybe it is less, with intention. Less clutter, more clarity. Less noise, more truth.

This little act of folding, sorting, giving away
felt like a kind of homecoming. A reminder that growth is not always loud or dramatic. Sometimes, it is soft. Messy. Quietly brave.

I’m learning, how minimalism is not about getting rid of everything.
It is about choosing, gently, what stays close to you.
And knowing when to let go, with love.

If this stirred something in you, I hope you use it as a sign to bring some sanity back into your life or.. send it to someone who could use a day of decluttering cuz it genuinely works out so well. 🫶🏻✨

Everyone has their most frequented airline and for me, it’s IndiGo. Since the time I started travelling solo, I have taken at least 200 IndiGo flights. ✈️ 

When I had to go from Delhi to Guwahati for the first time on a solo trip, or when I had an impromptu plan to visit Manipur from Calcutta, or when I took that flight to Sri Lanka very recently…IndiGo has been a part of so many of my adventures. It’s allowed me accessibility to some of the coolest places in India and abroad, it’s allowed me to travel economically without compromising on anything and they continue to serve. Day in and day out. 🫶🏻

I now take full advantage of being a BluChip member and earn points on all my IndiGo flights. It’s quite fun. 😉

Anyhoo, I’d love to highlight some of my favourite benefits of booking directly on the goIndiGo.in include:

1. Deals and discounts through the year
2. Low convenience fee
3. Hassle free cancellation and refund for Rs 299
4. Getting 50% extra* IndiGo BluChips on all bookings.
5. Students can get extra 10 kgs baggage and a 10% off.
6. More savings on family bookings :)

Now I’m eyeing their direct flights to Seychelles, Kenya and the UK. 

So, where are YOU going next? And is there a time when you had an adventure because of a deal on IndiGo? Share in the comments :)💃🏻💃🏻

I don’t know if I love this life because I have lived it for two years now
or if it’s something deeper
a quiet remembering,
like my body was always meant to be near the sea. ✨

I don’t know if I could ever live away from the tropics,
away from the warmth, the wildness, the salty breeze.
I don’t know if I could go back to radiators and layered clothing and grey skies. 🥰

Because I have fallen in love here
with the frogs that sing outside my window,
with the snakes I now meet with curiosity rather than fear,
with the monitor lizards that laze across garden walls,
with the spiders I talk to,
with the way my cats chase butterflies and climb trees like they were born to. 🌴

I love that I can hear peacocks every evening,
that the air smells different with every shift of season,
that even without winter the long monsoon brings its own kind of intensity,
and makes me slow down,
makes me rest. 🙏

Goa was never the plan
neither was this life.
Moving to Bangalore with/for my partner felt wild
but moving together to a small village in Goa felt even wilder.
And somehow this is where it all began. ✨

This is where I started therapy,
where I really began to listen to myself,
where healing quietly took root,
where care became a practice
not a luxury. 😊

And now care lives in small everyday rituals
cotton clothes
cold showers
fresh flowers
barefoot mornings
And in my skincare too
My NIVEA Deo Roll On with 0% alcohol, avocado oil, and pearl extracts gently takes care of my skin, all day, every day. Come rain or sunshine. 

I don’t know where I will go next, but for now I am here.
And I am so grateful for this unexpected coastal life…
for everything it has given me
and everything it continues to teach me.

Not all brains love structure the same way and that’s okay 🌸 Years of frustration, comparison, low self worth and self esteem eventually made me accept my brain for how it is. Absolutely, amazingly ✨imperfect✨

Structure doesn’t have to be rigid, it can be soft, flexible, and even fun!

So @ria.mohta and I made something super cool on Canva that’s ADHD-friendly and thought we will share the love with ya’ll✨💃🏻

For the forgetful, the scattered, the creative, and chaotic brains who deserve a system that actually works for/with them.

Introducing: untitled.jpeg, a planner template that’s flexible, forgiving, and fun.

🧠 No clutter

📅 No rigid schedules

🌼 Yes to dopamine-friendly colours, gentle reminders, and space for ✨ actual ✨ feelings and mind maps

This planner hits different, it’s so personal, all over the place and still so fun to use: 

• Works with my energy, not against it
• Built-in structure that doesn’t feel like a punishment
• Designed to reduce overwhelm, not cause it
• Comes with space for messy days, brain dumps, and ✨ small wins ✨

Made for my neurodivergent mind, but honestly helpful for anyone who feels a little all over the place.

Because planning shouldn’t feel like a personality test. It should feel cathartic.

Okay bye, Imma go romanticise my to-do list now and report back to tell you how I’m doing 🐣

So yeah in case you’d like the same for yourself, comment “plan” to get a pdf of the same 💚🍢 and may you all get a friend like @ria.mohta 🥰😭❤️‍🩹

still continues to be..but at least now i don’t compare myself with others, at least now i don’t feel ashamed of being ‘fat’, at least now i don’t carry the weight of being 80 kgs +, at least now i don’t look at my body as an excuse for not being able to do things others can.

whatever happens now, whether i loose this weight or not..it doesn’t matter. i’ve now understood that its our inner peace and health that must always be a priority. 

and for the first time, i feel free in my body..
because it’s mine.
because it carries me.
because it’s alive.
because it has held me through pain, joy, change, and healing.
because it lets me move, feel, rest, love.
because it doesn’t need to look like anyone else’s to be worthy.
because it deserves kindness, not criticism.
because it’s done nothing but show up for me, every single day.

and maybe that’s what love really is
not perfection, not control, not shrinking yourself to fit in.
but showing up for yourself, in soft ways.
being patient on the hard days.
forgiving the mirror when it feels heavy.
choosing nourishment over punishment.
choosing softness over shame.
choosing to stay, even when it’s easier to disconnect.

i don’t know what the future holds for my body.
but i know now:
it is not my enemy.
it’s not something to fix.
it’s the place i live in.
the only home i’ve ever had.

and finally, finally,
i’ve started to treat it like one.

so angry,
so sad all the time. 

I was on an emotional roller coaster
all day,
everyday. 

Something had to change,
Most things had to be unlearnt.

The negative self talk, 
the constant self sabotage,
the habit of seeking perfectionism,
the need for validation, 
the need to be needed,
the needed for constant external reassurance.

I was so far away from myself, from my core, from my inner child. I knew I couldn’t go on like this. So, in February, I registered for a 200 hour Yoga Teacher Training Course which not only strengthens your knowledge of Yoga, but also allows you to teach it someday, to others, if you’d want to (most people opt for other courses and specialisations after this beginner course, if they really want to be a proper teacher). I was so skeptical at first..oh I don’t know if I can, oh but what if this, what if that…all sorts of excuses came bubbling up to the surface. After postponing it once, I was going to postpone it again. But this time, I stood my ground and faced this big 24 day commitment that I’d paid the advance for. 9/24 days have passed and I feel like I’ve been here since forever.

I love love love my routine, my batchmates, our teachers, I love all that I’m getting to learn about the body, the mind and the soul. We have classes all day from 5:30 am to 7:30 pm. We start with Pranayama and end the day with Meditation. The types of Yoga we have include Vinyasa, Hatha, Yin, Aerial, Ashtanga and SUP. Then in theory, we study Teaching Methodology, Posture corrections, Yoga Anatomy and a lot more. 

I’m in school and no one’s forcing me to be here- I’m here with all my heart and soul. There are shifts happening all across my nervous system, i’m unlearning so much, i’m coming face to face with so many fears and honestly, I needed this for myself.

I needed this so badly. 

In two weeks, I’ll graduate from here. I have to give a written exam and a practical one but my current focus is more on getting to hold on to my headstand by the end of it. 🤣

I don’t know if I will be a teacher someday but I do know I am here to be better and live better.

And for now, that’s all that matters. ✨

If you’re planning a trip to soon, you might wanna save this one!

It’s the kind of place where you can be both a mountain and a beach person in the same day! 

- From the underwater waterfall illusion at the coast of Le Morne (which can only be seen from air btw), 
- To the rainbow-hued dunes of Chamarel called ₹ coloured earth. 
- and the crater hike at Trou aux Cerfs

Every place here feels unreal! 

- You can also go hiking up the mountains of Le Morne
- Take a snorkeling boat tour to Île aux Cerfs, 
 - and spend your days between Belle Mare, Point d’Esny, Trou aux Biches, and Flic en Flac beaches where you can swim, journal or chase sunsets.

💻 HOW TO BOOK: I booked the tour through @james_munyiri_safari and can’t recommend him enough (reach out to him if you want to plan a trip to Kenya, Whatsapp: +254 722225107)!

DAY 1: Nairobi to Maasai Mara
🚗 Picked up from the airport, we headed south to Maasai Mara, with a stop at the breathtaking Great Rift Valley. Checked into KEEKOROK LODGE, and dived straight into an evening game drive. Witnessed the sun setting over the Mara and spent over an hour with a LEOPARD - an unforgettable start! 🌅🐆

DAYS 2/3: Full Day Maasai Mara Safari
🌞 Early mornings and thrilling game drives - two full days of spotting so many animals - countless lions, zebras, elephants, cape buffalo, giraffes, wildebeest, and cheetah. We went up to The Mara River (great to see the Great Migration but we weren’t lucky the day we visited), and the Keekorok Lodge became our home, offering warm dinners and cozy overnights after exhilarating days in the wild. 🦁🦓

DAY 4: Masai Mara to Lake Nakuru
🎈 A sunrise Balloon Safari, visiting a Masai Village and a journey to Lake Nakuru - the LAKE NAKURU LODGE awaited us. Lunch on the way, and we were mesmerized by the wonders of Lake Nakuru National Park! Flamingoes, diverse birdlife, and a comfortable night’s rest in the jungle. 🦩🦓

DAY 5: Lake Nakuru 
🌅 An early morning game drive at Lake Nakuru where we spotted tons of rhinos (Big 5 done in Kenya!) followed by a scenic drive to Naivasha. Enjoyed a Boat Ride in Lake Naivasha and spotted hippos and pelicans in the water. Then settled into the serene SAWELA LODGES. 🚤🦩

DAY 6: Naivasha to Nairobi
🚙 Had a laid-back morning in Naivasha and drove down to Nairobi. Tried some Ethiopian food for lunch and headed to the Giraffe Center where we got to feed some giraffes, which was such a cool experience! 🦒

If you have more time, you can also visit Amboseli National Park and maybe do a trip to Zanzibar (both things I wish I’d done).

You can customize your tour with @james_munyiri_safari.

Széchenyi Thermal Bath is an absolute must-visit, with 18 pools, stunning Art Nouveau vibes, and mineral-rich waters straight from natural hot springs. This is the largest medicinal bath in Europe; from steaming outdoor pools to saunas and salt chambers, it’s the perfect spot to soak, sweat, and chill. 🛁

Pro tip: Book online to skip the line and enjoy a seamless experience with a private cabin for your stuff (I paid 32 euros for the private cabin but I think the price has gone up to 39 euros now). Whether solo or with friends, this iconic bathhouse is relaxation at its finest. And besides this, there are tons of other thermal baths in the city worth checking out too!

Malta surprised me! It’s tiny, but getting around still takes time! Buses are affordable but slow, so ferries and cabs save you time if you’re short on days. Most major spots like Valletta, Birgu, and Mdina are within 30–45 minutes of each other. 🚖⛴️

Also, Gozo is way more relaxed than the main island — you can explore it in a day but I recommend spending a night there like I did to really get a feel of the island. 🏝️ 

And yes, you can easily do a beautiful, full sightseeing day under €150 if you plan well (I wasn’t trying to be on a budget as such and since I was switching islands, I ended up spending a bit more than I would have). 💰

Would you call this expensive or pretty fair for a full day in Malta? 🤔

I spent 5 days in Malta, and honestly, it felt just right — enough time to explore Valletta, Mdina, Gozo, the Three Cities, and the Blue Grotto without rushing. 🌊

I absolutely love Italy and Croatia (and hope to visit Greece soon!), so this isn’t to discourage anyone from going there. Malta just surprised me in the best way. And even though it’s quite popular among Europeans, I hardly see any Indians visiting it.

✈️ How to get there: Flights from India can be surprisingly affordable if you book in advance — mine was just 27,000 rupees one-way from Bangalore (Qatar Airways). There are also daily flights from most European hubs.

🏨 Where to stay: I stayed in Sliema and one night in Victoria, Gozo.
✨ Sliema: perfect for cafés and sunset strolls along the promenade.
✨ Valletta: ideal for history, museums, and charming streets.
✨ St. Julian’s: best for nightlife, restaurants, and the island’s liveliest vibes.
Getting around is easy!

🚖 How to get around: Ferries and cabs are affordable. Buses are well connected, though a bit slower. Renting a car gives you freedom to explore at your own pace.

If you’ve been dreaming of a Mediterranean escape with history, blue waters, and laid-back island charm, Malta needs to be on your list! 🏝️

Here’s my 5 day itinerary for Malta:

Day 1 – Valletta: Start in the capital city! Walk through centuries-old limestone streets, do a walking tour, visit St. John’s Co-Cathedral, Upper and Lower Barrakka Gardens, and the Grand Harbour. Stay for sunset drinks by the waterfront. Try a 7 course tasting menu at a Michelin guide restaurant - Legligin (it’s vegetarian friendly).

Day 2 – Gozo: Take the ferry to Gozo Island which is smaller, greener, and quieter. I did a hop-on-hop-off bus tour to explore Dwejra Bay & Blue Grotto, Ta Pinu, Ġgantija Temples, Ramla Bay, and the coastline. Spent the night in Victoria.

Day 3 – Back to Malta: Start your morning exploring the Citadel in Victoria. You can visit Comino Island (Blue Lagoon) for a swim or head back to Malta and visit The Three Cities (Vittoriosa, Senglea & Cospicua) — full of fortifications, cafes, and charm.

Day 4 – Mdina & Rabat: Step into a medieval movie set (Game of Thrones was shot here). Mdina’s narrow alleys and golden glow are magical at sunset. Rabat nearby is great for local food and history lovers. Have some cake and tea at Fontanella Tea Room with a stunning view.

Day 5 – South Malta: Explore the stunning Blue Grotto, the colourful Marsaxlokk fishing village (go on a Sunday for the market!), and Malta’s ancient temples like Ħaġar Qim & Mnajdra that are older than the pyramids!

💡 Things to know if you’re planning a trip to Malta:
	🛂 Visa: Malta is part of the Schengen Zone, so if you already have a Schengen visa, you’re good to go.
	💶 Currency: Euro (€)
	☀️ Best time to visit: April–June or September–October with warm weather, clear water, and fewer tourists.

I’ve quickly fallen in love with the quirks and hidden treasures this beautiful state has to offer and all I want is for you to experience the best places that have been the back drop of so many memories in my life 😍

From camping in national parks with my friends in my early twenties, spontaneous solo day trips when no one was free, working my first corporate job in regional Victoria to mum and daughter adventure weekends and meeting my interstate boyfriend at a waterfall along the Great Ocean Road… these places are so special! 🥹

This guide includes 300+ locations (and counting) that have captivated my heart, left my jaw on the floor, taken my breath away and made all my Victoria adventures that much more amazing! 📍

👉🏼My guide is currently on presale until EOD Saturday 7th June (launch day on Sunday) so comment “MAP” to get it while it’s hot! 🔥 

Thank you for all your support and allowing me to show you the best of Victoria 🥹🫶🏻 x

👑You can tour either Fairy Cave or Royal Cave (Royal Cave is pictured here)

📍Freycinet National Park (2.5 hours from Hobart CBD)
My favourites were the Mt Amos hike (we did a sunrise hike) and Honeymoon Bay for sunset! 🥾

📍Maria Island (1 hour from Hobart CBD)
The best place in the state to see free roaming wombats! A walk to the Painted Cliffs at low tide is also a must! ⛴️

📍Eddystone Point Lighthouse (2.5 hours from Launceston CBD)
The best spot to see the red lichen covered rocks that make the Bay of Fires so special + there’s a lighthouse here too!🔥

📍Bruny Island (30 minutes from Hobart CBD)
We did this as a day trip, took the ferry over, saw white wallabies, went to the iconic Bruny Baker’s Bread Fridge and did the Bruny Island cruise! 🌊

📍Little Blue Lake (2 hours from Launceston CBD)
Originally a mine hole, the lake reflects a vivid aqua blue from the minerals in its base and there’s lots of vantage points to view it! 💙

📍Mt Paris Dam (1.5 hours from Launceston CBD) 
The structure was created by hand for the local mining industry, and in 1985, a hole was blasted in the wall to allow the flow of the Cascade River - now it’s such a magical scene! ✨

📍Trowutta Arch (3 hours from Launceston CBD) 
A short 1km return trail takes you through a beautiful rainforest-like setting to a magical arch way and still algae-covered cenote! 🌿

📍Cradle Mountain National Park (2.5 hours from Launceston CBD) 
Check out Ronny Creek to see wombats, do the Dove Lake Circuit or head up to Hansons Peak or Marions Lookout! 👀

The water is so inviting but if you go for a dip I can confirm you won’t be able to feel your body after 30 seconds 😅

In the middle of the day you’ll have full sun on the pool but you might also have to share the place with a few other people so you choose what’s best for you - I went in the morning and we had the place all to ourselves! 🙌🏻

🌿Rainforest Gully & moss covered trees

Steavenson Falls is probably my favourite waterfall in Victoria, even after visiting almost 80 of them across the state - it’s floodlit everyday until 11pm at night and creates a truly magical and unique experience you can’t have anywhere else in Victoria! 🔦

Flowing all year round and accessible via a short 700 metre return walk from the car park (perfect for wheelchairs and prams) this waterfall has 4 different vantage points for viewing including a platform on either side, a bridge in front at a distance downstream and a platform at the top which can be accessed by a 800 metre walk uphill. 🥾

The best things about viewing at night are - no crowds, you can actually get a carpark, a different perspective of the falls and you avoid the heat of the day (especially in summer!) 🙌🏻

Imagine you invested in the stock market index of each of these countries back in 2010...

If you were invested in the US, you would 6X your money in the past 15 years... which is almost 12.5% p.a.

Had you invested the same money in the Sensex, you would have 5X your money... which is around 11% p.a.

And had you invested in the Chinese index in Shanghai, you would have just 1.3X your money or made less than 2% p.a.

But why is it that China has boomed so much over the past two decades, but their stock market has almost remained flat since 2010.

Even right now, the PE multiple for the US is above 26X, for India is above 22X, and for China is just at 14X...

Which means investors don’t believe in its growth story compared to that of India and the US.

This is because of 3 main reasons:

1/ Almost half of the stocks listed on the Shanghai Composite are State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), similar to what we call PSUs in India, or Govt Owned Entities

And while the Private Players deliver 2X the Return on Equity compared to the SOEs, the latter keep the overall performance of the index down.

This brings us to the second reason, which is - Are Chinese SOEs not productive?

2/ Now the biggest paradox is that China’s GDP growth rate has no correlation to the stock market return - because while India and the US economy are highly dependent on the population buying and consuming products...

China’s GDP growth has come on the back of massive government spending, which is not always profit conscious...

So anyone who has invested in the Chinese index has had half of their money go into long term infra projects which are not the best for shareholder returns.

3/ And here comes the third reason - that despite China’s high spend on infrastructure growth, why are investors still giving it such a low PE and not betting on its future...

Because the Chinese government is unpredictable.

For the safety of passengers, this is being done to reduce the workload on the fewer staff at the airports.

New Zealand is seeing one of the largest exits of its population...

Almost 20% of the citizens of New Zealand have left in recent years... with the highest number of over 120,000, making up almost 2.5% of the population leaving in 2024 alone.

But why are people leaving, and how are Indians using this?

People are leaving because housing prices are unaffordable, and the Kiwis find better job offers in Australia, which is an open economy to NZ citizens.

At this time, in 2024 alone, NZ has seen the largest inflow of Indians... over 27,000... and in June 2025, NZ has started recognising Indian degrees, not requiring Indians to pass additional exams in their country to fill in the shortage of labour... which is at a 50 year high!

There are 5 major types of skills which have been Green Listed that immediate residency visas are being given for:

1/ Healthcare Workers, i.e. Doctors, Nurses, Medical Lab professionals

2/ Engineers in Construction, Civil, and Construction Product Managers

3/ Software Engineers, Database Managers

4/ Environmental and other scientists

5/ Primary and Secondary Teachers

Even accountants and trade specialists are in demand.

For this visa, people need to give a letter of full time employment from a NZ employer along with proofs of skill and experience.

And most people who go to NZ use it as a backdoor entry to Australia legally...

By working in NZ for 5 years on residency, people apply for and get citizenship...

Once they get citizenship, they become eligible to work in Australia... so they go across to Australia in search for better pay, and then in 4 years of working in Australia... apply for Australian citizenship.

And one pattern I’m seeing emerge across the world is a huge demand for nurses - across Germany, Italy, Japan, Australia and New Zealand.

Populations are growing older... and they need skilled people from younger economies, paying them 3X the salary they get in India... nurses and healthcare professionals being the most in demand from India.

China is run by Engineers, US by Lawyers, Russia by the Security Forces, India by Generalist Bureaucrats, and the Middle East by Royal Technocrats...

👉🏻 China’s politicians used to be mostly from an Engineering background, which is why the country has historically taken economic decisions based on optimization... building structures to solve problems mathematically... 

which is why apart from economic growth, they also built math into social problems like the “One Child Policy”, and “Zero Covid Policy”, which backfired.

So while doing business with China, you should follow the hierarchy strictly, and talk more about science and efficiency than creativity and art.

👉🏻 Most members of the US Congress and most of the earlier US Presidents have been Lawyers... so the country has historically been run by judicial rights, procedural reviews, lots and lots of arguments... and is now moving towards being run by Businessmen.

So while dealing with Americans, be absolutely certain of the paperwork because they could sue you.

👉🏻 India has been run by the Bureaucrats that form the IAS... who are selected on a test that covers general knowledge more than technical skills...

And because highly virtuous and hardworking IAS officers could often go against political will and be transferred...

Thus, the country is run more by who you know than meritocracy.

👉🏻 Russia on the other hand is run by a President who has been part of the Security Forces for decades...

And thus the country prioritises national security over economic decisions...

And thus, as a foreigner doing business with Russia, you could be under surveillance as a foreigner, so always go as a friend, and be prepared to have opacity in decision making and not getting a reason for why it’s a yes or no.

👉🏻 The Middle East is run by Kings and Monarchs who are extremely innovation driven with a long term vision... which is why you see they’ve transformed the desert into the most desirable place in the world...

I’m talking about Rare Earths... and let me explain what they are... and why they are shaping geopolitical relations...

There are 17 rare earth elements in the world, which are the most essential ingredient of every EV, every smartphone, every speaker and every defence equipment and fighter jet you see...

Neodymium is the most used today as it is used to make permanent magnets that are part of all these equipments... And the rarest of them all is terbium, which is extremely rare.

Quite like oil shaped the world economy for the past century...

The next economy is being built around rare earths... but their concentration of supply is even more pronounced than that of oil.

China has almost 37% of the world’s reserves... Brazil has 18%... and India has 6%...

Where India holds more reserves than USA, Russia, Australia, Canada, Vietnam, and all other countries in the world...

Such that just these 3 countries of China, Brazil and Russia have 60% of the world’s reserves...

But having reserves is not enough... Mining and Refining them is the real challenge... and China recognised this 30 years ago when in the 1990s it started tapping into its rare earth reserves such that it controls 90% of the rare earths today.

And this is also the reason why the US China tariff issue has been resolved even before the US India tariff issues can because China can stop all the supplies for any electronic or defence equipment that could be used by the US by just curtailing supply of rare earths to any country.

Mining and Refining them is extremely polluting to the world, and the reason Western countries have not done it is to meet their carbon emission goals.

Now, Oil has its substitutes in renewables, and Gold is just a store of value in uncertain times...

But its Rare Earths that don’t have substitutes as of now... and the world needs them such that the demand is going to be almost 6 times over the next 20 years... with price appreciation expected to be between 12-18% p.a. by 2040.

I’ve done this by comparing Lenskart’s numbers and figures from Q1 FY 2025-26 (i.e. April to June 2025) across listed startups and traditional retail players.

By these numbers, the valuation may seemed to have been reasonable for all the institutional investors who are putting in money in the company.

Though, I must clarify that I don’t invest in IPOs, and this in no way is any recommendation for you to invest or not invest. This is only to educate on the method you should follow.

Please also add other ratios in your analysis that take into account balance sheet figures, and look at things like Return on Capital, Return on Assets, along a lot more, like Payback Period of Capex, etc.

I have pulled out data from several sources on the internet, adjusted and annualized to Q1 of FY26, so a few numbers may have changed when you look at current date figures.

I could have also made mistakes, and made a few reasonable assumptions in the data - but use sources like Screener, Perplexity, Capital IQ, and published reports of these companies to see for yourself.

Also, this video is much longer than the 3 minute limitation on Reels, so I know it won’t work as well as my other videos, but to crunch this in less than 3 minutes may grab headlines but not deliver true value.

This is because: 

👉🏼 The EV battery is easily 30-40% the cost of the total car...

And people have very little trust in what the condition of the battery is when they’re buying something in the used car market.

As there is no true battery health meter, and every manufacturer uses their own software, there is currently no standard measure to independently evaluate the health of an EV battery.

👉🏼 With the tech advancement in EVs, the range that you get in a new EV two years later is much higher than that in an old EV, so because of faster obsolescence, it makes sense to buy a new car

It’s almost like how at one point people prefered to buy a new phone than a used phone because they couldn’t open the phone to check or didn’t know if the battery was good enough to work.

👉🏼 So this is what you should when you are buying an EV:

1/ Ask the manufacturer on what is the warranty on the battery... so that you get at least 10-15 years of working life from the car, such that even if you sell it, the buyer has a warranty on the battery from the manufacturer itself.

It’s said that BYD has now introduced 8 year warranties, and Tata may launch 15 year warranties on some models... but this is only for first owners. Also ask the warranties for second owners.

2/ Ask them if the company has the option to swap the battery if it falls below a particular standard of performance, and if there is Battery as a Service, where you can swap to a new battery.

For example, some MG models are said to have a rental for the battery where you pay a fixed price per kilometer as rent for the battery instead of owning the battery.

3/ And if you have to buy a used EV, please get a Certificate of State of Health (SoH) from the car manufacturer, such that there should not be more than 2% battery loss for every year of the car’s age... and maybe get certified pre-owned to be safe.

And this concept is playing out among the AI companies too...

Where Nvidia is the father and companies like Open AI are the sons...

These AI companies like Open AI need semiconductor chips to keep their businesses running... which are all supplied by Nvidia... who is also an investor in them...

So Nvidia invests USD 100 Bn in Open AI with a condition that they will buy semiconductor chips from them... 

OpenAI’s valuation increases, Nvidia’s sales increases... and all these companies are now investing in each other and paying money to each other to inflate both their valuations and revenues.

Such that Nvidia has now become the most valuable company in the world... and is at a 30X Revenue Multiple... Open AI is at an almost 40X Revenue Multiple...

And what does Sam Altman have to say about this?

He agrees that the market is in a bubble, but he has to play this game because these AI firms are now competing with each other fiercely and they have no other option.

He has admitted that even the USD 200 per month plan is unprofitable and the cost of compute is higher than the revenue it generates.

Now, how does it impact you?

As an end user of AI tools, it’s a great time because every AI company wants to give you things for free to lock you as a user.

And who is paying the price for this? In a great way, the US stock market investors.

As a customer, enjoy while it lasts. And as an investor, it’s best to be safe and have a balanced portfolio. Don’t go all in on either stocks or gold. Just focus on wealth preservation in uncertain times.

I’m talking about Japan, Germany, Finland, and Taiwan...

👉🏼 Germany is the most desperate for Indians as there are over 700,000 jobs across healthcare, IT, engineering and construction...

So Germany has announced a Focus on India plan last year, by which they now want to issue 90,000 skilled work visas to Indians annually up from 20,000 earlier...

And the average Indian in Germany earns close to Rs 6 lakhs per month

They no longer require an IT worker to have German proficiency, and you may have no degree in software development, and you could still be eligible with two years of coding experience.

Average salaries in IT would range from Rs 40 to 80 lakhs depending on the experience and expertise... and engineers in Pharma and Chemicals are getting on an average close to Rs 70 lakhs per annum.

👉🏼 Japan has just signed an agreement with India by which 500,000 people will be migrating over the next 5 years...

Their focus is on getting engineers and IT professionals... which are said to take up 20% of all IT jobs in Japan... and median salaries are expected to be around Rs 40 lakhs.

Whereas Nurses would make Rs 3-4 lakhs per month.

👉🏼 Finland is offering Permanent Residency to skilled workers who hold a master’s degree and can pass a language exam in Finnish or Swedish...

Indians in Finland have risen by 350% in the past decade, and an EU Blue Card is being offered to skilled workers in healthcare, IT and engineering.

👉🏼 Taiwan wants to import people who can work in manufacturing, and are preferring labour from the North Eastern states due to cultural similarities.

The cost of living is 4X of India... so while your expenses will also go up, but if you save 20% of your salary in India, and 20% in Japan... the savings amount in these countries in absolute terms could be 3X of your India savings.

This shows that there is more profit opportunity in serving financial services to ultra HNIs than to serve simple food to the masses...

50% of all total spending in the US is now done by 10% of the top households... and they have 90% of the investments in the stock market, but only 5% of the household debt... 

And this is not limited to the US... but applies to almost all major economies where wealth inequalities are rising, including in India.

Then what do governments and central banks do to make the masses afford more...

They make interest rates lower to flood the market with more money... and this money goes largely into the hands of the wealthy, who keep driving stock markets and real estate up, while inflation increases for the masses, and they buy more, but with just more debt.

And the masses would have more job security two decades ago, but now the masses live constantly thinking and knowing that a job is possibly just as risky as a business... where they may actually be laid off tomorrow.

In such a case, there are two things you can do:

- If you are starting a business, please create one to cater to the HNIs and premium client only.

- If you are in a job, either you will have to spend hours learning new skills daily.

1/ Look out for countries that are subsidising flight tickets to promote exotic, offbeat destinations.
For example:

Thailand is subsidising tickets for 200k tourists - but only if you skip Bangkok.

Vietnam wants you in Da Nang, not just Hanoi - offering up to 50% discounts on hotels and attractions through its “New Da Nang - New Experience” program.

2/ There are also a few international destinations where travel has become cheaper because the INR is getting stronger against their local currencies.

The biggest wins here are Japan, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka - where you now get 3.5 Sri Lankan Rupees per 1 INR, making a full SL holiday doable within ₹60,000 per person.

3/ Within India, a limited-fare initiative called “One Route, One Fare” is live from October to December on select Alliance Air routes - including Shimla, Diu, Guwahati, and a few other tier-2 cities. Under this scheme, the ticket price stays fixed whether you book months in advance or even on the day of travel.

These points are key because 75% of New Year’s Eve bookings happen in the last three weeks of December, and the first two weeks of November are when stays and flights are roughly 25% cheaper for December vacations.

4/ In November, there is a Travel ka Muhurat Sale being run by MakeMyTrip, launching on 29th of October, to capture all the travel bookings for December. It’s one of the biggest travel sales the industry has seen - with offers like free stays, free upgrades, and 20–25% extra savings across categories.

A little early to say, but happy holidays.

Let’s look at some data to understand how this works...

Since 2020, housing prices in India have skyrocketed, rising by almost 10% p.a., while incomes are only rising by about 5% p.a.

Such that the rates are absolutely unaffordable in cities like Mumbai and Gurgaon where you would need anywhere between 20-30 years of income to buy a house...

Currently, all developers are building ultra luxury homes in India...

Such that affordable housing inventory has dropped by 70% in Hyderabad, 60% in Mumbai and 50% in NCR over the past 2 years...

And this is because builders want to make higher margins and cater to a premium customer which is not price sensitive...

And at the same time, institutional investors in Indian real estate have reached almost USD 9 Billion in 2024, which is an over 50% increase from 2023...

And out of these institutions, 63% are foreign investors, while only 37% are Indian institutions.

And from an overall economy perspective, India faces a shortfall of 10 million homes, potentially increasing to 30 million in the next decade...

And here’s what happening right now...

Over the past 6 months, the sales volume of real estate developers has dropped sharply...

But prices are still stable and holding on... so there is no price crash, but currently there is no price increase either...

And because the owners of a lot of the current units are either NRIs, foreign institutional investors, or just the uber rich, they may not be desperate to sell at a loss...

And house prices have never crashed in India earlier on an average, so I’m expecting there to be a multi-year stagnation in price where for the next 2-3 years, you shouldn’t buy in panic that prices will go up...

In fact, know that today, you kind of have an upper hand in negotiating with developers because a number of them are desperate to meet their sales targets.

The company powers the operating software that you see on the infotainment panel, digital dashboard, and driver panel in your car... It controls the entire software operations for EVs including advanced driver assistance systems, handsfree communication, and telematics...

For every major auto brand including Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Honda, Toyota, Volkswagen, Hyundai, Kia...

It’s in fact so big that 24 out of the 25 largest EV makers in the world, and the top 10 automakers use it in their car...

Such that over 250 million cars around the world use the Blackberry software called QNX.

And it’s said that today to build an OS for cars is so complex that Boeing airplanes run on 7 million lines of code, but car OS for new EVs run on 500 million lines of code...

And Blackberry has beaten Apple in this domain because Apple has burnt USD 10 Billion in building a similar system, but shut down operations while QNX succeeded.

QNX currently does a lot more software development in medical devices, aerospace and defence, and boats of numbers such as an 80% gross margin and over 30% EBITDA.

While it is no where close to the size of the Blackberry mobile phone business... 

but it’s telling of the fact that there are huge wins and opportunities even when the world thinks something you’ve been working on has been a failure.

Trump’s new rule could make thousands of immigrants lose their job in America

The USCIS just dropped a new “interim final rule.” and here’s what’s happening:

Every immigrant needs a work permit called the *EAD,* to legally work in the U.S.

Until now, if you were on H4 EAD or AOS EAD, the government gave you a grace period upto 540 days to work while your renewal was being processed.

but starting October 30th 2025, once your EAD expires, your work permit expires with it.

USCIS says this is to “strengthen vetting and protect national security.”

This will Mainly affect H-4 EAD holders, adjustment-of-status applicants, and a few other visa categories that used to get this automatic grace period.

So, skilled immigrants, green card applicants and even spouses of H-1B workers may lose their jobs for no fault of their own.

Note that If you’re on OPT or STEM OPT, this likely doesn’t apply to you.

Also, If you file your EAD renewal before October 30, 2025, you’ll still be covered under the old 540-day rule.

So if your EAD is expiring anytime in late 2025 or early 2026, file early and renew your work permit atleast 6 months before expiry.

Track your case status regularly and Avoid job gaps by alerting your employer in advance.

This doesn’t apply to STEM extension EADs so all my f1 students you are fine.

- Skip the “Objective” section because they already know your goal is to get hired.
- Instead, write a professional summary that highlights your experience, skills, and impact.

- Don’t include your full address — your email and phone number are enough for recruiters to contact you.

- Add your education only if you have less than five years of experience, and move it to the bottom.

- Structure your resume in this order: Work Experience, Projects, Skills, Education, and Leadership.

- Under each role, include 3–5 bullet points showing what you did and the measurable results you achieved.

He spent 2 weeks reading Cracking the PM Interview, doing mock interviews, and binge-watching YouTube prep videos.

Third, during interviews, he spoke about his projects from his 3.5 years experience at Visa as a backend developer in India

This way he cleared all three back-to-back rounds at Microsoft.

At Purdue, his ABM program gave him weekly career sessions and 1:1 resume reviews.

And their accelerated 1.5-year program helped him graduate faster and start full-time work sooner.

Recently Emily Glassberg Sands, who leads Data Science at Stripe, recently said she’s hiring more new graduates than ever before.

But even with all that, she says that she’s worried.

In 2025 AI tools like ChatGPT, can do many of those beginner tasks faster and cheaper.

Companies are letting AI handle the easy work that used to teach new workers how to get better.

So even though companies are still hiring, the types of jobs that actually teach you how to grow are quietly disappearing.

Emily said she’s not afraid of hiring new talent but she’s afraid of what happens after.

Because without mentorship, without seniors to guide, review, and correct, we’ll have a generation that knows the tools but would lack skills.

Even AI leaders like Anthropic’s CEO warn that automation could wipe out a large share of entry-level white-collar jobs in the next few years.

So if you’re starting your career, you’ll need to build your own projects, network with people and use AI as a teacher, not just a tool.

so what do you think? will AI replace entry level jobs or entry level learning?",,1169,15

According to you, what makes someone choose a life in the army despite knowing the risks?

In today’s episode, we have @majorkavish (Retd) Advocate, Supreme Court and former JAG Officer in the Indian Army who shares what life inside the forces is really like: the pride, the discipline, and the everyday challenges behind the uniform.

Here’s what we discussed:
- Who actually holds more power the Army or the Police? 
- What special privileges do army officers really have behind the uniform?
- Why can’t an officer simply resign and what does “court martial” truly mean? 
- Is there corruption inside the army, or is it just a myth civilians believe? 
- What’s the real life of a soldier like from mental pressure to personal struggles?

Do you think success changes how honest we can be with the world?

In today’s episode, we have one of India’s most powerful performers, @nawazuddin._siddiqui. He says he never came to become a star, he just simply wanted to act. We talked about his childhood, from being bullied for his skin colour to growing up with an honest father who failed at many things in life but lived by one rule: never lie. He shared how those early experiences shaped the way he views truth, failure, and success today.

Here’s what we discussed:
- What does Nawazuddin Siddiqui really think about anger and rejection in love?
- Why does he believe it’s better to be underconfident than overconfident?
- How did acting teach him to recognise lies and understand human truth?
- Why does he say honesty has become rare in today’s world?
- What helped him stay fearless during the lowest phase of his career and why does he never ask for work?

While closing may look like the easy choice, it can hurt your credit score by reducing your credit limit, shortening your credit history, and weakening your credit mix.

 Here’s the smarter way to think about it:
When Closing Makes Sense:
The card has high annual fees and doesn’t give enough value.
Too many cards are tempting you to overspend.
You’re worried about security risks on an idle card.
If none of these apply, keeping the card open is often better.

Smarter Option: Downgrade Instead of Closing
If fees are the only problem, don’t cancel.
Ask your bank to downgrade to a lifetime free / zero-fee version.
This keeps your credit history and limit intact, while saving you money.
No hard inquiry is triggered, unlike applying for a brand-new card.
Best of both worlds: low cost + strong score.

If You Must Cancel, Do It Right
Clear all dues before closure.
Redeem reward points or cashback.
Keep your oldest card open to protect credit history.
Reduce balances on other cards so your utilisation doesn’t spike.
Check your credit report to confirm “closed by customer.

Let me explain 👇

In June this year, RBI reduced the repo rate by 50 basis points, which lowered EMIs — but only for those with floating-rate loans, i.e., loans where interest changes when the RBI’s repo rate changes.

But now, RBI has announced a big update that lets everyone reduce their loan interest.

Whenever you take a loan, the interest rate is made up of two parts:

IRS (Internal Reference Rate) — based on your loan repayment term
+ Spread — extra margin added by the bank based on your credit score

So, the better your credit score, the lower your spread and interest rate.

Earlier, banks were allowed to change this spread only once every 3 years, which meant even if your credit score improved, your EMI stayed the same.

But from 1st October, RBI has removed this restriction!
Now you can tell your bank:
👉 “My credit score has improved — please revise my interest rate.”

And if your bank refuses, you can simply transfer your loan to another bank offering a lower rate.

Over the years, this small step can save you lakhs of rupees in interest! 💰

So check your credit score today — and share this video so more people can benefit from this RBI update. 🚀",,1272,12

Both Rich Dad and Poor Dad invested the same amount in Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY) at the same interest rate.
But still, Rich Dad earned more returns.

👉 How?

Because Rich Dad knew the secret timing rule of SSY!

📌 What is SSY?
	•	SSY is a government-backed savings scheme for the girl child.
	•	It offers a fixed interest rate (currently ~8.2% per annum in 2025).
	•	It is 100% risk-free and also comes with tax benefits under Section 80C.

🔑 The Secret Rule: Start your SSY investments Before 5th of the Month”

Interest in SSY is calculated on the lowest balance between the 5th and the last day of the month.

➡️ This means:
	•	If you deposit money on or before the 5th, you earn interest for the full month.
	•	If you deposit after the 5th, that month’s interest is lost on that amount.

📊 Example:
	•	Suppose you deposit ₹1,00,000 on 4th October → You earn interest for the whole of October.
	•	But if you deposit ₹1,00,000 on 6th October → You earn zero interest for October on that money.

Over 15–20 years, this small difference every month compounds into lakhs of extra earnings!

✅ The Rich Dad Hack:

Always start investment in SSY on or before the 5th of every month.
That’s the difference between ordinary returns and Rich Dad returns

- Protection from Creditors: The policy proceeds are shielded from creditors, meaning that even if you have outstanding debts, the insurance amount will reach your beneficiaries without being seized to settle loans.

- Protection from Relatives : The policy proceeds are protected from relatives or other individuals who may have claims on your assets, ensuring that your wife and children receive the intended benefits.

-Legal Protection: The MWPA policy cannot be attached by courts to repay outstanding debts or loans, and the beneficiaries have sole authority over the policy proceeds.

In the early years, almost your entire EMI goes towards interest, not the principal. That’s why even small prepayments can save you lakhs. 

Thankfully, RBI has also removed prepayment penalties on floating-rate loans. 

so whenever you have surplus cash, use it to cut your loan tenure short. 
Plus, don’t forget the tax perks: up to ₹1.5 lakh on principal repayment (Sec 80C) and up to ₹2 lakh on interest (Sec 24b). 

First-time homebuyers even get additional deductions.

Now, here’s how you can finish a 25-year loan in just 10 years 👇

Strategy 1: Pay 1 extra EMI every year. 

Instead of 12, pay 13 EMIs—this directly reduces your principal. Result: Loan tenure drops from 25 years to 21 years.

Strategy 2: Increase your EMI by 7.5% annually. 
Year 1 = ₹33,000, Year 2 = ₹36,000, Year 3 = ₹38,000, and so on. As your salary grows, your EMI grows too. Result: Tenure shrinks from 25 years to 12 years.

Strategy 3 (Best): Combine both: pay 1 extra EMI + increase EMI by 7.5% every year. 
This aggressively reduces your principal and slashes interest. Result: Loan tenure cut from 25 years to just 10 years.

Bottom line: Banks design loans so that you end up paying 2.5x the loan amount if you stick to their schedule. 
But with these smart strategies, you can become debt-free 15 years earlier, save lakhs in interest, and enjoy financial freedom for your dreams, investments, and family.
And one last tip, on loan closure, the bank must return your original property documents within 30 days. If they delay, RBI allows you to claim ₹5,000 per day as penalty. 

Always collect a no-dues certificate and ensure your loan account shows zero balance.

Don’t just compare interest rates, check hidden charges, reset frequency, and tenure flexibility. A well-structured home loan not only saves money but also secures your financial peace of mind.",,1879,13

1️⃣ A professional photoshoot – research shows women who invest in self-image build stronger personal brands, leading to higher career opportunities.
2️⃣ A timeless jewel – India’s women buy 40% of the world’s gold, but the true value lies in sentiment + story, not just grams.
3️⃣ A signature scent – neuroscience proves fragrance links to memory. Your perfume can make you unforgettable.
4️⃣ A silk pillowcase – dermatologists say it reduces hair breakage by 43% and wrinkles by 27%. Small luxury, big returns.
5️⃣ A solo plane ticket – 61% of Indian women still hesitate to travel alone. Don’t be the statistic, be the story.
6️⃣ A power dress – studies show wearing clothes that boost confidence enhances performance by up to 20%.
7️⃣ And of course, financial literacy – the ultimate purchase that keeps paying you back.

👉 Don’t wait for others to validate you. Buy the things that remind you: I am HER.

But here’s the truth every consumer should know:

 👉 GST is applied on the bill date, not on the stock. That means if you buy something on or after 22nd September 2025 it must carry the reduced GST.

 👉 As per the rules under Legal Metrology & GST Act MRPs on packaged goods must be revised or re-labeled to reflect lower prices. Sellers can even display dual prices (old MRP + revised MRP) but they cannot charge you the higher one.

 👉 Section 171 of the CGST Act 2017 clearly states any reduction in GST must be passed on to the consumer. Keeping that benefit is illegal profiteering.
What you should do as a smart consumer:

Always check your bill date when you shop after 22 Sept.

Look at the MRP label. If it hasn’t been revised ask for clarification.

If you’re still charged extra file a complaint on the National Consumer Helpline 1800-11-4000.

And if you’re wondering which products got cheaper and which ones costlier after 22nd Sept
 Comment “LIST” and I’ll share the full list of goods and revised GST rates with you.

Your small action protects not just your own money but also ensures businesses don’t misuse the system.

🧒 Early Years (2–6) → Play money, piggy banks, and learning needs vs wants.
👧 Middle Years (7–12) → Pocket money, savings goals, and making smart shopping choices.
👩 Teen Years (13–18) → Budgeting, supervised bank accounts, basics of investing, and part-time work to respect hard-earned money.

🌱 And through it all—children mirror what they see. If we save, budget, and spend wisely, they will too.

The real gift isn’t just teaching them how to spend or save—it’s teaching them that money represents time, effort, patience, and values. That discipline > income, and gratitude > greed.

Because when kids learn to value money early, they’re not just preparing for wealth—they’re preparing for life.",,789,11

Here can be your best picks 👇

1. Liquid Fund

Got idle money for a few days or weeks? Don’t let it sit in your bank!
 Park it in a Liquid Fund → safe, flexible & gives ~5–7% annual returns.
 Perfect for 1 day – 1 month.
 Better than savings account, almost no risk.

2. Short-Term Debt Fund

Need to park money for 1–3 months?
 Go for Short-Term Debt Funds.
 They invest in corporate & govt bonds → giving ~6–8% annual return with low risk.
 More rewarding than FD for short horizons!

3. Medium-Term Debt Fund

Have a 3–12 month horizon?
 Medium-Term Debt Funds can be a smart pick.
 Return potential: 7–8% annually.
 Slightly higher risk than FDs but great for short-term planning.

4. Corporate Bond Fund

Planning for 1–3 years?
 Invest in Corporate Bond Funds → they put money in AAA-rated company bonds.
 Return potential: 8–10% annually with low risk.
 Safer than direct corporate deposits, more rewarding than FDs.

5. Equity Mutual Fund

For 3+ years, nothing beats Equity Mutual Funds.
 Direct stock exposure, long-term compounding → 12–15% average return over time.
 Short term = risky, but long term = wealth creator.
 Best for long-term goals like buying a house, child education, or retirement.

but it can actually cost you crores. My friend did this, and lost out on ~₹2.35 crore of profit.

If instead, she had taken a ₹1.8 crore home loan (20 years @ ~8%) and invested the remaining ₹1.8 crore at ~7% return, that investment would have grown to ₹6.97 crore. 

After paying back the loan (₹3.6 crore), she’d still keep ~₹3.37 crore net profit.
Plus, home loans give powerful tax benefits: up to ₹2 lakh interest deduction (Sec 24b), and ₹1.5 lakh principal deduction (Sec 80C). 

Even after capital gains tax, she’d still be in profit.

Lesson? Don’t block your entire money in a flat. Use the bank’s money, invest smartly, and let compounding work for you.

Did you know?

• Education loans in India start from around 7–9% p.a., much lower than personal loans.
• Under Section 80E of the Income Tax Act, you can claim a full deduction on the interest paid, with no upper limit, for up to 8 years.

Why this is powerful:

You borrow ₹15 lakh at ~9% interest → get interest deduction, bringing your effective rate down to about 6–6.5%.
Meanwhile, you park your ₹15 lakh in a safe FD or debt fund earning 7–7.5% → net gain of 1–1.5%, plus tax savings, plus credit score boost, plus repayment flexibility.

Key takeaways:

Education loans can actually be cheaper than you think.

Section 80E makes them even smarter—maximizing your returns.

Smart borrowing beats draining your savings.

Use it wisely, don’t miss EMIs, and grow credit while you grow your child’s future.

Keeping money in the wrong savings account = burning your money 🔥
Why?
Because traditional banks still give you only 2 to 3% interest, on top of which minimum balance penalties, SMS fees, and hidden costs keep eating into your savings.

🚀 That’s why people are moving to Smart Banking.
Take slice savings account:

✔️ Earn 100% of RBI repo rate (currently 5.5% p.a.)
✔️ Interest credited and compounded daily so your money grows every day
✔️ Zero balance account with no hidden charges
✔️ Safe and insured up to ₹5 lakh by DICGC

💡 Example: Keep ₹2 lakh → earn ~₹11,300 in a year
Hold it for 10 years → approx ₹1.5 lakh in interest alone

So stop letting your money lose value.

It is just based on anecdotes or folktales. Since there was no harm in trying, I decided to give it a shot!

I also paired these with lots of exercises, walk & a general active lifestyle ⚠️ Always consult your doctor before introducing any foods in your diet or starting any exercise!

1. Cinnamon 🥣 : One of the most common spices believed to induce labour pains. It has a calming effect however it is not a proven method for induction
2. Fresh pineapple 🍍 : It contains the enzyme bromelain & common belief is that it helps to soften the cervix & encourage contractions. Eat about 1 cup pineapple per day (canned will not work!)
3. Dates 🌴: They contain fiber & prostaglandins which may help ripen & dilate the cervix shortening the first stage of labour & increasing the likelihood of spontaneous labour. Aim to eat 6 dates a day!
4. Papaya 🥭: Unripe or semi-ripe papaya can induce labor due to its high concentration of latex & the enzyme papain that can cause uterine contractions. I ate ripe papaya & wasn’t too regular with it!
5. Raspberry Leaf Tea ☕️ : It tones uterine muscles leading to more effective contractions, shortens the first stage of labour & may reduce delivery interventions. I had about 3 to 4 cups per day!

For Hyderabadis, Kheer Puri is not an everyday sweet, it’s a tradition reserved for the blessed occasion of Milad-un-Nabi ﷺ.
On this day, homes would come alive with the aroma of kheer simmering and puris puffing, as families gathered around the dastarkhwaan to celebrate with love and togetherness.

Amtul Faheem from @ammi.ke.khane recalls a cherished memory, her sister once stubbornly demanded Kheer Puri from their mother. But by the time it was prepared, she had already fallen asleep, leaving behind a story the family still laughs about.

Back then, children in every home eagerly waited for this special treat, calling out, “Ammi, Kheer Puri banao!”
Today, many bakeries have started selling Kheer Puri, and while the taste may be there, the joy of making it at home, the togetherness, and the love in every bite are missing.

That’s why she says, make Kheer Puri at home. Because some dishes are not just about flavor, they’re about faith, family, and timeless memories.

✨ Special Dish: Hyderabadi Kheer Puri, best enjoyed on Milad-un-Nabi with loved ones.

Recipes ⬇️

Btw, I have 25 more chia pudding recipes to share!!! Coming up soon❤️

✅Start with one simple base:
Mix 6 tbsp chia seeds + 3 scoops Oziva’s Vanilla Plant Protein + 150 ml watwr + 600 ml milk. Stir and let it thicken for 5-6 hours in the fridge.

Now for the fun part, first divide the chia pudding base in 3 parts👇

🍌1. Banoffee Chia Pudding - 500 Cals
Layer chia base → 1 caramelized banana (cooked for 5 mins with cinnamon powder and some butter on a pan) → few toasted walnuts → another layer of chia pudding→ top with more banana, crushed walnuts & 1 tsp nut butter.

☕️ 2. Mocha Chia Pudding - 480 Cals
Mix the chia base with 1 tbsp cocoa powder. Whisk 100g Greek yogurt with 1 espresso shot & sweetener of choice.
Layer chocolate chia pudding → coffee yogurt → repeat → top with dark chocolate nibs & chopped cashew.

🍓 3. Peanut Butter & Jelly - 510 Cals
Cook a few blueberries on low flame with 2–3 tbsp water for 4–5 mins until jammy, add lemon zest. Layer chia base → blueberry compote → 1 tsp peanut butter → repeat → finish sunflower and pumpkin seeds.

💚 Each jar gives ~35g protein! Store in the fridge for 3 days in airtight containers and repeat the process on wednesday night🥰

.
Welcome to Day-1 of Transforming My Dad🤝
.
Waking up at 4 a.m. every day allows me to take full control of my time and set the tone for a productive day. As an online fitness coach, my mornings are sacred. I use the quiet hours to focus on myself before I start serving others. This early start gives me time to plan my clients’ programs, respond to messages, and prepare for online sessions without distractions. It’s not just about waking up early, but about being intentional with every hour prioritizing my energy, discipline, and mindset so I can show up as my best self for my clients 🙌🏻

Time management is the foundation of success, both in fitness and in life. When you learn to manage your time, you create structure, consistency, and balance all of which are essential for achieving long-term goals. Without a plan, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and lose focus. But when you take charge of your schedule, you take charge of your results. Whether it’s sticking to your workouts, eating right, or running a business, mastering your time helps you stay consistent, reduce stress, and make steady progress toward your goals ✅

Trying Bombay street food and sushi for the first time was such a wild mix of flavors and experiences for me. The Bombay street food instantly hit me with its bold spices, strong aromas, and the chaotic energy that comes with every bite. I loved how every dish had its own surprise - something crispy, something tangy, and something that made my mouth tingle with spice. It felt like a full-on flavor explosion, and even though it was messy and intense, there was something really fun and comforting about it 🥰
.
Sushi, on the other hand, was the complete opposite - calm, clean, and elegant. I remember being surprised by how simple it looked but how balanced the flavors were: the freshness of the fish, the slight sweetness of the rice, and that little kick from the wasabi. It felt more about appreciating each bite slowly rather than being overwhelmed by flavors. Experiencing both cuisines made me realize how food can tell such different stories,one full of color and chaos, the other quiet and refined and I honestly loved both in their own way 🙌🏻

I tried sushi for the first time today, and it was such a unique experience. At first, I wasn’t sure what to expect but the presentation looked so elegant and delicate, with the rolls neatly arranged and a burst of color from the fish, rice, and vegetables. The first bite completely changed my perspective on raw fish; it was surprisingly fresh, soft, and flavorful. The combination of textures ,the smooth fish, and a hint of wasabi and soy sauce,created a balance that felt both light and satisfying 🙌🏻
.
What stood out the most was how clean and refreshing it tasted compared to most other dishes I’ve tried. Each piece felt like a small, well-crafted work of art, and I could really appreciate the simplicity and precision behind it. It was more than just a meal,it was an experience of flavor and culture. Now that I’ve tried it, I understand why sushi is so popular, and I’m definitely excited to explore more varieties next time 🙌🏻

I almost got lost in Mumbai airport 😂 One minute I was walking confidently like I knew where I was going, and the next I was in a completely different area wondering if I took a wrong turn into another terminal, Every corner looks the same 😭

Shiny floors, endless signs, and people running like their flight’s already in the air.
For a moment, I thought I’d just settle there and start a new life maybe open a small stall called Harsha Lifts.

Anyway, I somehow made it out alive, so yeah surviving Mumbai airport should count as a full workout 😂

Fulfilling a childhood dream hits differently..
it’s more than just ticking something off a list; it’s an emotional reminder of how far you’ve come. Ever since I watched the movie Orange, Bombay had a special place in my heart: the vibe, the energy, the stories hidden in every corner of the city. Today, standing here and seeing it all in real life feels surreal. It’s like that little version of me, who once dreamed about this moment, is smiling somewhere inside. Every sight, sound, and feeling reminds me why dreams are worth holding onto ❤️

To everyone reading this, never give up on your dreams, no matter how small or far away they seem. Life has a beautiful way of rewarding those who stay patient and persistent. The journey might take time, but when you finally reach that destination, every struggle and wait makes sense. Keep believing, keep pushing because one day, you’ll be standing in the middle of your dream, just like I am today 🙌🏻

When I was a child, I used to watch my friends excitedly talk about their flight trips,the clouds they saw, the snacks they got, and the joy of flying. I’d run home and ask my mom why we couldn’t do the same, and she would smile softly and say, “Maybe one day, when we can afford it.” At the time, I didn’t fully understand what that meant, I just knew my mom worked hard to give me everything she could, even when life gave her so little 🥹

Today, I hold a flight ticket in my own hands,one I bought with my own money. It’s proof that I made it somewhere she always dreamed I would reach. But as I stand here, I can’t help but feel a deep ache in my heart. Because this moment, the one she always wanted for me, feels incomplete without her by my side. I wish she could see how far her love and sacrifices have taken me, I wish she were here to fly with me, just once..❤️

Back when I was fat, everyone used to clown me “Bro, no girl’s gonna look at you until you lose weight!” Fast forward: I hit the gym, dropped the kilos, got abs, confidence, the whole glow-up package… and still can’t pull a girl to save my life 😭 Like bro, I changed my body, not my luck! Turns out six-packs don’t guarantee text-backs .

Anyway, I’ve got a date today dressed up, made a reel, feeling like the main character. If this doesn’t work, I’m just gonna start bulking again for emotional support. Wish me luck, boys it’s time to find out if all those hours of cardio were worth it or just character development 😭🔥

After 20 years of avoiding papaya, I finally decided to give it another shot mostly out of curiosity. Growing up, I couldn’t stand the smell or the texture, and it was one of those fruits I swore I’d never touch again. But something about seeing it freshly cut this time made me think, “Why not?” So, I took a bite, fully expecting to regret it immediately ‼️

To my surprise, it wasn’t bad at all in fact, it was actually good. The sweetness, the smooth texture, and that refreshing aftertaste completely changed my mind. Maybe my taste buds just needed two decades to evolve, or maybe papaya wasn’t the problem… I was. Either way, I’m officially team papaya now proof that sometimes, you’ve got to give old dislikes a second chance ✅

Why these exercises are mistakes ? Here’s the explanation :
✅ Planks are fine before babies but after delivery women’s tummy goes through a condition called Diastasis Recti and planks worsen the gap between the 6 pack ab muscles making the tummy look protruding even more like you are still pregnant. Side plank is the perfectly safe alternative. 
✅ Crunches again should be avoided if you are postpartum mom as it worsens the DR, hip bridge marching is the perfectly safe alternative for this. 
✅ Excess everyday cardio and zero strength training can ruin your fat loss progress as it won’t contribute in building muscle, so 1 day cardio and 4 days strength training is perfect combo for fat loss + strength building. 
✅ Light and  colourful dumbbells are ok for few weeks if u are a complete beginner, but gradually increasing the weight of dumbbells can help with better progress and breaking plateaus. 
✅ Flexibility traning is great but without mobility training there are lot of chances of injuries so more focus should be done on mobility speacially when u start your fitness journey after a long gap.

Guilty for eating too much, for not being perfect. And most mornings, I’d wake up already feeling defeated. I’d failed before the day even started.

I spent years stuck in that cycle, eating as little as possible then bingeing when I couldn’t take it anymore and promising myself I’d “start over Monday.”

Going too low didn’t make me disciplined. It made me miserable. I was exhausted, burnt out, and constantly thinking about food.
 
And that’s when I learned what worked in my teens sure as hell didn’t work in my 30s.

The moment I started fueling my body instead of punishing it, everything changed my energy, my mindset, my results.

They weren’t.

I became a mom at 19, while everyone else was out finding themselves, I was trying to raise a tiny human and hold myself together. Working full time to support my husband through school, Sleep deprived, Stressed, Living off caffeine and whatever I could grab that was easy.

My skin broke out WORSE than in highschool, my gut was wrecked and my body constantly felt inflamed.
I lost myself.

I had 2 more kiddos and I thought that was just how motherhood had to feel, tired, puffy, anxious and stretched thin.

But it wasn’t.

I had to learn the hard way that you can’t pour from an empty cup.
That healing your gut, fueling your body, and finding peace again isn’t selfish.

Real energy, confidence in my skin, strength that comes from taking care of myself, not punishing myself.

I didn’t really feel like my body had changed that much.

But one day, my sister looked at me and said, “Get on the scale.” I laughed it off, but I did it, and I was 155. That’s when I realized I had weight blindness.

The scale had slowly crept up over time. A few pounds here, a few there. And because I wasn’t paying close attention, I didn’t notice just how far off track I had gotten.

Here’s the thing, it’s 100% okay to be whatever weight if you feel good, strong, and healthy. But I wasn’t. I was tired, bloated, uncomfortable in my skin, and deep down, I knew I wasn’t living in alignment with how I wanted to feel.

Sometimes we need people in our lives who will lovingly tell us the truth. Who won’t let us keep living in denial. Who will help us pull our heads out of the sand and face reality.

No one’s going to save you. Not a new outfit. Not a round of Botox. Not a Monday start date. Not another round of excuses.
You have to get honest with yourself and decide to take your power back.

Your measurements or clothes are changing: Body fat loss happens before the scale always reflects it. Your jeans or sports bra fit tell the truth faster than the scale does.

You’re feeling more energized, not depleted: A proper deficit shouldn’t leave you exhausted or foggy. If your energy is stable throughout the day, that’s a good sign you’re fueling enough while still in a deficit.

You’re noticing small hunger cues You should feel slightly hungrier at times, that’s your metabolism working …but you shouldn’t feel starved or obsessed with food.

Your strength is improving or holding steady: If you’re maintaining or increasing strength in your lifts, it means you’re losing fat, not muscle …exactly what you want.

You’re consistent without perfection: You’re tracking most days, hitting protein, and staying within range & not giving up every weekend or starting over on Monday.

These are the real indicators your plan is working,not just the number on the scale. Fat loss is a process, and the women who see it through are the ones who focus on these signs, not just weight.

Most People Pick the Wrong Niche 😬

They chase trends…
Pick random topics for views…
Or follow advice from someone who doesn’t know their situation…

Then a few months in, they burn out or realize they can’t actually make money from it.

Here’s the truth:

If you pick a niche you don’t care about (or that isn’t profitable)...

You’re setting yourself up to fail before you even start.

That’s why I created a free training that shows you how to pick the right niche.

One that aligns with your interests and can actually get you paid.

Most people post videos and pray they go viral…

But they’re starting with weak hooks that no one cares about.

That’s why your content flops.

If your hook doesn’t stop the scroll, nothing else matters.

No views = no sales, no followers, & no growth.

But when you know how to craft the right hook?

You can turn a random video into one that hits a million views—and brings in money, clients, and opportunities.

The aircraft, identified as Flight AI171, was a Boeing 787 Dreamliner carrying 230 passengers and 12 crew members.

The flight took off from Runway 23 at 1:39 PM IST, and according to officials, it issued a MAYDAY call moments later.

Contact with Air Traffic Control (ATC) was lost soon after, and the aircraft reportedly crashed minutes after departure, just outside the airport perimeter.

The flight was being operated by Captain Sumeet Sabharwal, a senior pilot with over 8,200 flying hours, and First Officer Clive Kundar, who had logged 1,100 hours of experience.

Eyewitnesses reported heavy black smoke billowing from the crash site. Emergency response teams, including firefighters and police, immediately sealed off the area and began rescue operations.",,925,10

Back pain at an early age can be caused by poor posture, especially from spending long hours sitting hunched over phones, computers, or school desks. Carrying heavy backpacks incorrectly, lack of regular exercise, or weak core muscles can also put extra strain on the spine. In some cases, injuries from sports or sudden movements contribute to discomfort.

Medical conditions can play a role too. Issues like scoliosis, herniated discs, or congenital spinal abnormalities may develop during childhood or adolescence. Additionally, being overweight or experiencing high stress levels can worsen back problems by increasing physical or muscular tension.

Babies are flexible because their bones are softer and made up of more cartilage than adult bones, allowing their bodies to bend and adapt easily. Their joints and ligaments are also looser, which helps them fit through the birth canal and move freely as they grow.

This flexibility plays a key role in their development, making it easier for them to learn to roll, crawl, and eventually walk. Over time, their bones harden and their joints stabilize, gradually reducing that natural bendiness as they get older.

Most adults need 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night to function at their best. This amount helps the body repair tissues, regulate hormones, and maintain a healthy immune system. While some people feel fine on slightly less, consistently sleeping under 6 hours can lead to fatigue, poor focus, and long-term health problems.

Quality matters as much as quantity. Deep and REM sleep are essential for memory, learning, and emotional balance. Irregular schedules, stress, and screens before bed can reduce sleep quality, even if the total time seems enough. A consistent bedtime routine and good sleep environment help adults get the full restorative benefits of sleep.
